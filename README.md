>To complete my Data Analysis project I am using Purchase Dataset from e-commerce website. 
>This data set contains information about 290.000 transaction collected from marketplace. It consist of 5 columns item, include of column of purchased. Columns :
1. user_id = customer id
2. timestamp = time when customer access the matketplace website
3. group = control and treatment group
4. landing_page = the section of a website accessed by clicking a hyperlink on another web page. 
5. purchased = 0 : there is no purchase, and 1: there is purchase

>My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


>#### **Question that can analysed from this data set**
> 1. Probability of purchase regardless of the page, of control group, and of treatment group
> 2. If i want to assume that the old page is better unless the new page proves to be definitely better at a Type I error rate of 5%, What are my null and alternative hypotheses should be?
> 3. Get P-value to make a decission accept/reject null hypothesis
